I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.fsu.edu/) at Florida State University.

My research interests include statistical network analysis, Bayesian inference, machine learning, data science, and statistical computing.

### About

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://stat.illinois.edu/), advised by Professors [Yuguo Chen](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/yuguo) and [Ruoqing Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/teazrq/home). I received an M.S. in Physics from [Yale University](https://physics.yale.edu/) and a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from [Duke University](https://physics.duke.edu/).

From 2015 to 2018, I was a Data Scientist at [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), a start-up in Boston aimed at building an automated machine learning platform. During my physics career, I worked as a particle physicist as part of the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. There I performed large-scale data analytics and helped develop a Deep Learning framework for classifying subatomic-particle jets.
