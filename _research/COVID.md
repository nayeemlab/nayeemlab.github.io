excerpt: 'The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) and Joint External Evaluation (JEE) are prominent indices used to assess health security and related capabilities. We hypothesized that countries with higher GHSI or JEE scores would detect their first COVID-19 cases earlier and experience lower mortality compared to countries with lower scores (1). This study aimed to evaluate trends in the reported case fatality rate (rCFR) of COVID-19 over time, utilizing global data on COVID-19 cases and mortality to understand the impact of these indices (2). The COVID-19 pandemic, originating from Wuhan, China, has spread globally, prompting countries to implement various measures to control the outbreak. This research assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 in Southeast and South Asia using a mixed-methods design, combining cross-sectional surveys and systematic reviews (3). The pandemic has significantly impacted public health, economies, and daily life, with a particular focus on evaluating the state of COVID-19 testing, recoveries, infections, and deaths from June to September 2022 (4). Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has proven effective in forecasting disease outbreaks in developed countries with centralized sewage systems. However, implementing WBE in developing countries like Bangladesh, where many live in rural areas with less defined sewage networks, is challenging. This study identified optimal sampling locations for rural Hotspot Based Sampling (HBS) and urban Drain Based Sampling (DBS) to enable effective WBE monitoring and forecast COVID-19 prevalence in Bangladesh (5). Additionally, we analyzed mutation patterns in 10,531 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, focusing on Delta and Omicron variants. The study examined mutation frequency, type, and the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous mutations to understand the genetic diversity of the virus (6). Another study explored the effectiveness of WBE for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in a house with COVID-19 patients, comparing wastewater samples with clinical specimens over a 30-day period. This approach offers a cost-effective, rapid, and non-invasive method for monitoring public health (7).
Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring (WBEM) serves as a valuable surveillance tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides early warning, tracks disease trends, detects genetic diversity, and identifies new variants from wastewater samples. Despite its advantages, clinical diagnostic tests (CDTs) remain the global standard but face challenges such as high costs and reporting biases. This review proposes a combined approach using both wastewater and clinical sample testing to enhance long-term nationwide surveillance (8). Comparative analysis of global reported cumulative case-fatality ratios (rCFRs) and excess mortality rates before and after the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination programs highlights the impact of vaccination on mortality rates in the top 20 countries with the highest vaccination rates, as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the rest of the world (9). The pandemic, with 676.41 million confirmed cases and 6.77 million deaths across 231 countries as of February 7, 2023, has caused widespread disruption. Determining potential determinants, such as meteorological factors, is crucial for controlling the virus's spread. This study explores how COVID-19 cases and deaths have varied over time in relation to meteorological conditions (10). Additionally, the research investigates whether fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and meteorological conditions are linked to COVID-19 infection rates in Bangkok, Thailand, addressing the inconclusive evidence on environmental factors' impact on infection rates (11).'
