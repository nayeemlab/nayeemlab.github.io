excerpt: 'Dengue virus (DENV) is an arthropod-transmitted, single-stranded RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family. Bangladesh, highly susceptible to severe outbreaks due to climate, location, and population density, requires analysis of meteorological factors to predict trends. This study employed five time series models and four statistical models to forecast and understand DENV cases (1).
Dengue virus infection has significantly impacted Bangladesh, with record-high prevalence and fatalities in 2022. Favorable mosquito breeding conditions in June and July exacerbated the issue. Without a vaccine, enhancing awareness of dengues epidemiology and improving urban infrastructure to prevent mosquito breeding are crucial for better management (2).
In 2022, Bangladesh recorded its highest dengue-related deaths (281) since 2000. Unlike previous years, the outbreak saw a late surge in cases and fatalities during cooler months (October–December), deviating from the usual August–September peak (3).
The 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh highlights the urgent need for improved epidemic control, with lessons from Bangladesh crucial for managing surges in other Southeast Asian countries and globally (4). 
This study aimed to compare dengue cases, deaths, case-fatality ratios, and meteorological factors between 2000–2010 and 2011–2022, analyzing trends, seasonality, and the impact of temperature and rainfall on dengue dynamics in Bangladesh (5).
In 2023, Bangladesh experienced its largest and deadliest outbreak of Dengue virus (DENV), reporting the highest-ever recorded annual cases and deaths. We aimed to characterize the geographical transmission of the DENV in Bangladesh (6). 
In 2023, Bangladesh faced its worst dengue outbreak since 2000, highlighting the need for better prediction methods. This study uses machine learning, evaluating Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to improve forecasting accuracy (7).'
