excerpt: 'This study compares Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for predicting school attrition among female students in Bangladesh. By evaluating these methods' effectiveness, we applied logistic regression to forecast attrition risk and compared the predictive and classification accuracy of both models using real data (1). Additionally, in response to Bangladesh's severe dengue outbreak in 2023, the study explores advanced machine learning techniques—GRU, RNN, and LSTM—to improve dengue forecasting. Unlike previous research, this study integrates a broader range of factors and algorithms, analyzing data from January 2000 to December 2022 to enhance prediction accuracy and support proactive public health measures (2).'
