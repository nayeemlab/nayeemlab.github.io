excerpt: 'Aging presents a significant challenge in Bangladesh, with its impact progressively intensifying and leading to a range of serious consequences. Older adults often face new and complex health issues, with many suffering from chronic conditions. Research was conducted to assess the health status, depression, and daily functioning of elderly individuals in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh (1). Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a leading cause of illness and death in developing countries, including Bangladesh. Data was collected from elderly individuals in urban, rural, and ethnic areas of the Sylhet region using a stratified random sampling with proportional allocation. The study involved 230 participants aged 60 and above, including 110 women and 120 men. A multiple logistic regression model was employed to assess the major risk factors associated with CHD in this sample group (2). Additionally, a major contemporary health issue is the rising prevalence of chronic diseases among young adults. This study aimed to identify risk factors for chronic disease and determine the prevalence of such conditions in individuals aged 18 to 39 (3).'
